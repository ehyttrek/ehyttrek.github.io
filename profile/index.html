                <h2>What I want to learn</h2>
                <p>
                I want to learn how to better code. How to better integrate the 'ingredients' of the web as we know it today: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and serverside scripting (such as PHP).
                </p>
                <p>
                I also want to improve my skills in teaching these skills to others. Or at least the skills that I have mastered so far (or more precisely: of which I believe I have mastered them).
                </p>
                <p>
                Last but not least, I am interested in 'the big picture'. How does it all fit together? How is coding a part of our current culture? Is it a 'language' our kids should learn in school? Will it really make a difference once 'the machines' take over? Will it not be more valuable to focus on the human skills, the social skills, the soft skills, the interpersonal communication skills? Or ist it all the same â€¦?

                <h2>What I already know</h2>
                <p>
                I was trained a graphic designer. That is: an old school graphic designer. Before computers, before Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, before desktop publishing and before 'the web'.
