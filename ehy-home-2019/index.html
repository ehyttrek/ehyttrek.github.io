                <h4>About this website</h4>
            <p>
            When thinking about re-designing my website at the beginning of autumn 2019, I was determined to keep it as simple as possible, as far as the technology was concerned. That means: no CMS, no framework, no external resources. Just plain native HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript, with resources such as web fonts hosted together with the site.    
                </p>
                <p>
                This decision came within the context of two lines of thought, the most important of which was (or is): how to develop environmentally sustainable websites. Sites that use as litle resources as possible and create a carbon footprint as small as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                At the same time I wanted it to make a showcase for my classes on HTML/CSS (and some JavaScript) basics. Teaching these basic web development techniques to mostly absolute beginners is what I do a lot these days. Being a graphic designer by training and not a developer makes this not only a teaching experience for me, but also a continuing learning experience. This is one reason I like this work.

                I find coding exciting and fun. But I am instantly bored by nerd talk. As a developer I couldn't compete in today's so called 'fast paced' business environments, I am just not professional enough. Thank god. I an amateur. An amateur, by literal translation, is someone who loves doing something he or she is not doing for a living. Does this make coding my hobby? No

            <h4>What is an expert, really?</h4>
                    <p class="my-quote"><em>“A maniac is someone who doubles his efforts when he has lost his aim.”</em></p>
                    <p>
                    This quote seems to be a variation of an aphorism accredditet to George Sanatayna: “Fanaticism consists of redoubling your effort when you have forgotten your aim.”, but I once saw it in the form I quoted it above on an animation print in a shop in Los Angeles. The print showed Will E. Coyote in his neverending hopeless chase of The Roadrunner. The quote was written on four or five wooden signs rammed into the ground between them: the coyote on the left edge of the frame, the roadruner on the right.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The coyote may be a maniac, but while he is certainly not an expert in catching fast birds, he is still an expert in building machines designed to catch fast birds. Only they never work, but more often there is no explanation why. It is simply the coyote's immaculate expertise in failing that makes the machines fail too.<p/>
                    <p>
                    An expert often is defined by the ability to reach his aim with the minimal effort necessary. This is called efficiency. But does efficiency really help to get the best possible result? Certainly not. It more helps to get the best result with a reasonable amount of resources. That is a good thing, no doubt. Still the question remains, whether the maniac amateur may not come up with the better solution in the end.
