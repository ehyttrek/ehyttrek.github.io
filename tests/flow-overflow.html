            <p>
                I am a block element of the type section. As a block element I
                will always claim 100% of the horizontal space available to me.
                In vertical direction I will become just as big as the content I
                carry requires, as long as no one tries to manipulate my height
                using CSS. This is called flow. Sometimes it is even called
                "natural" flow.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="overflow">
            <h2>Overflow</h2>
            <p>
                I am also a section. I behave the same as my sister above, only
                that someone has given me the value 20vh (that is 20 percewnt of
                the viewport height) for my height property. You can see where I
                end (I am green, by the way, just like my sisters). But still my
                content goes further than my vertical size. This is called
                overflow.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="overflow overflow-hidden">
            <h2>Overflow Hidden</h2>
            <p>
                I am, as well, a section. In fact we all are the same in this
                aspect here on the page. We just have different flow or overflow
                behaviour respectively. Overflow: hidden in my case. My height
                is set to 20vh just like my sisters' above and below. You
                probably won't even see this line anymore in most cases.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="overflow overflow-scroll">
            <h2>Overflow Scroll</h2>
            <p>
                Well, same for me. I am a section with text inside (the text
                itself is in a paragraph of course, but that doesn't matter here
                now). My height also 20vh, therefore I have the overeflow issue
                as well, but in my case the user can scroll to see the entire
                text. That would be 'overflow: scroll', yes, you are right!
