            Just a little site with some HTML and CSS examples. Nothing fancy, not even made very professionally. For example: the navigation of this site is implemented by use of an iframe (for lack of a server side solution for embedded markup, or rather the laziness of the developer to set up an environment for that)! Don't try this at home kids …

            Well, nevertheless enjoy the stuff showed on the pages linked in the above navigation. Hope it will grow, content-wise …
