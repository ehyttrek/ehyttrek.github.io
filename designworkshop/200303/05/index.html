            <p>Massimo Vignelli is one of the world’s most acclaimed graphic designers credited for giving American design aesthetics a modern and streamlined look. His versatility enabled him to work in various areas such as corporate identity, packaging, houseware and furniture, public signage and wayfinding, and environments. Faithful to the Modernist tradition, his designs produced a fruitful career from his native Milan to New York. For more about this influential visionary, here are the following facts:</p>
            <h2>Vignelli believed that designers play a vital role in the world.</h2>
                <p>He considers himself an “information architect” whose role is to organize and simplify information to make it understandable.<br>In the film Helvetica, Vignelli likens designers to doctors who must cure and fight “visual ugliness”. </p>
            <h2>He graduated as an architect.</h2>
                <p>Vignelli received his degree at Politecnico di Milano and later attended Università Iuav di Venezia (“higher institute of architecture of Venice”).<br>He met his equally talented wife Lella at an architecture convention. They created the Lella and Massimo Vignelli Office of Design and Architecture, a small studio specializing in graphics, office accessories, and domestic products.</p>
            <h2>Vignelli formed two highly successful design companies.</h2>
                <p>He founded the now-closed Unimark International. Once one of the largest international design firm, its roster of clients included American Airlines, New York Transit Authority, and Ford Motor Company.<br>He and Lella formed Vignelli Associates where they expanded their clientele to include IBM, St. Peter’s Church, Bloomingdales and the United States National Park Service.</p>
            <h2>Vignelli controversially redesigned the New York subway map in 1972.</h2>
                <p>He depicted the “spaghetti” subway lines as straight stripes of color that turned at 45-degree angles. Many disliked the map because it disregarded geographical accuracy in favor of highlighting the relationships between the lines.<br>Vignelli’s map was replaced with a more traditional kind in 1979. It was revived in 2011 as The Weekender, a map that displays planned service changes to the subway for each weekend.</p>
            <h2>He greatly favored the Helvetica typeface.</h2>
                <p>He considered the endless collection of computer fonts as the “biggest visual pollution of all times.” He named five typefaces which a designer should only use: Helvetica, Times New Roman, Futura, Century, and Bodoni.<br>Vignelli’s works predominantly used Helvetica, which he likened to a piano that can play any tune depending on the skill of the designer.</p>
            <h2>He greatly valued education and sharing knowledge.</h2>
                <p>Aside from merely archiving their work, the Vignelli Center for Design Studies holds programs and exhibitions for public consumption.<br>He used his lectures at Harvard’s School of Design and Architecture as his basis to write “Vignelli: From A to Z”. He also released “The Vignelli Canon”, a free <a href="http://www.vignelli.com/">e-book</a> for young designers.</p>

            <p>In 1988, Thames & Hudson published part one of a two-volume set of Neville Brody’s work – The Graphic Language of Neville Brody, which became the best-selling graphic design book in the world. <br>To coincide with that, his work was exhibited at the Victoria and Albert Museum which attracted over 40,000 visitors.<br>He is a founding partner of FontShop and has designed many typefaces such as Industria, Insignia and Blur, which was included in the Museum of Modern Art’s architecture and design collection in 1992.</p>
            <p>Despite making a name for himself through his work in the 80s and 90s, Neville Brody’s recent work includes a rebranding of the BBC in 2011, a redesign of The Times’ typography in 2006 and on-screen graphics for Paramount Studios. <br>Research Studios has expanded from its London base in 1994 to several studios in Paris, Berlin, New York and Barcelona.</p>

            <p>David Carson is a prominent graphic designer and art director from the United States. He is most known for his grunge typography and radical magazine layouts. His instinctual and rule-breaking approach transformed contemporary visual communication. For more on this revolutionary designer, here are the following facts:</p>
        <h2>Graphic design was his second career.</h2>
            <p>Carson was a competitive surfer (ranked 9th in the world) and sociology teacher at a high school. He discovered his passion for graphic design at a two-week summer workshop.<br> He attended design school, but learned most of his skills as an unpaid intern at Skateboarder Magazine. He then took a workshop taught by Hans-Rudolph Lutz who served as Carson’s first influence.</p>
        <h2>His work at Beach Culture magazine was brief but rewarding.</h2>
            <p>The publishers of Surfer magazine contacted Carson to work as art director for Beach Culture. The quarterly tabloid folded after only six issues.<br> Despite its short run, the magazine earned Carson popularity in the design world. His innovative “dirty” style garnered him over 150 awards.</p>
        <h2>Advertisers sought his rebellious touch to appeal to the youth.</h2>
            <p>Subscriptions tripled when Carson served as art director of alternative music magazine Ray Gun.<br>
            His success at the publication brought him commissions from high-profile clients such as Levi Strauss & Co. and Nike. Aside from directing print advertisements, Carson also managed their television campaigns.</p>
        <h2> Carson did not use formulas, grids, or formats.</h2>
            <p>Ray Gun’s layouts varied per article, giving him great flexibility and freedom. This expedites Carson’s instinctive style where he “just (does) what (makes) sense”.<br> Carson overlaps color, pictures and type, often to the point of illegibility. To his critics he warns, “Don’t mistake legibility for communication.” He believes his greatest strength is his ability to communicate emotionally and visually.</p>
        <h2>Success followed him as he created his own studio, David Carson Design.</h2>
            <p>The design firm expanded its clientele to include Pepsi, Microsoft, American Airlines, Warner Bros., and Nine Inch Nails.<br> His first book sold over 200,000 copies and is the best-selling graphic design book in the world. It is entitled “The End of Print: The Graphic Design of David Carson”.</p>
        <h2>Apple Inc. named Carson as a “pioneer of profound impact”.</h2>
            <p>The technology company listed him as one of their 30 most  influential Macintosh users in their 30-year history. Only two graphic designers received this distinction: David Carson and April Grieman.<br> To date, Carson has received more than 230 awards over his career. These include Master of Typography, The Most Famous Graphic Designer on the Planet, and the AIGA (American Institute of Graphic Arts) medal.</p>
