    <h2>David Carson Work</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        Carson started his experimental journey with the wanderlust of the world of graphic designing in the early 1980's, also surfing being a ubiquitous part of Carson's life; it has played a significant role in his design career.

        One of the main reasons of his motivation and lead towards success is to maintain the direction and design various surfing, snowboarding, and skateboarding magazines, fortnightlies, websites, ads and products like Quiksilver, Burton, SURFportugal and TwSkateboarding.
