        package design, graphic design, furniture design,
         and product design. His clients at Vignelli Associates 
         included high-profile companies such as IBM, Knoll,
          Bloomingdale's and American Airlines.[18] His former
           employee Michael Bierut wrote that "it seemed to me 
           that the whole city of New York was a permanent
            Vignelli exhibition [around 1981]. To get to the office, 
            I rode in a subway with Vignelli-designed signage, shared
             the sidewalk with people holding Vignelli-designed Bloomingdale’s
              shopping bags, walked by St. Peter’s Church with its Vignelli-designed 
              pipe organ visible through the window. At Vignelli Associates,
               at 23 years old, I felt I was at the center of the universe."[19]
  
  Vignelli participated in the Stock Exchange of Visions project in 2007, 
  as well as publishing the book, Vignelli: From A to Z, containing 
  a series of essays 
  describing the principles and concepts behind "all good design".[20] It 
  is alphabetically organized by topic, roughly approximating a similar
   course he taught at Harvard's School of Design and Architecture.[21]
  
  Vignelli's designs were famous for following a minimal aesthetic 
  and a narrow range of typefaces that Vignelli considered to be
   perfect in their genre, including Akzidenz-Grotesk, Bodoni,
    Helvetica, Garamond No. 3 and Century Expanded. He wrote that,
     "In the new computer age, the proliferation of typefaces 
     and type manipulations represents a new level of visual
      pollution threatening our culture. Out of thousands of typefaces,
       all we need are a few basic ones, and trash the rest."[22]
  
  In January 2009, Vignelli released The Vignelli Canon as a free e-book;
   an expanded version was printed in September 2010,[23] but the original 
   remains available for download on the Vignelli Associates website.[24] 
   In the introduction Vignelli wrote, "I thought that it might be useful
    to pass some of my professional knowledge around, with the hope of
     improving [young designers'] design skills. Creativity needs
      the support of knowledge to be able to perform at its best."[24]
  
  Vignelli worked with the National Park Service and the design
   staff at the Harpers Ferry Center in creation of the "Unigrid System." 
   The system has been used since 1977 in creation of park brochures in all national parks locations</h1> .
