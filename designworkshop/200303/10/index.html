   <h1>Massimo Vignelli</h1>
       <img src="massi2.jpg" width="600" height="400">
   <p class="massi">Vignelli taught us to appreciate the functionality and elegance of simple, rational shapes—an aesthetic that is result of a deep cultural sensitivity, before being a matter of style or taste. His opera will always be an excellent example to make people understand the social value of design and to make designers understand the need to adopt a professional discipline that will allow to properly manage such a responsibility.</p>

   <h1 class="nev">Neville Brody</h1>
       <img src="neville-brody-collage-1.jpg">
   <p class="nev">Late 1970s is marked as the era of punk rock, thus the trend highly influenced Brody’s work and motivation. However, his experimentation with punk rock was not met with encouraging remarks by his tutors. One of his queer postage stamp design that featured Queen’s head sideways, almost had him expelled from the college. Despite the threat of being expelled he continued to explore the new boundaries in graphic design. Therefore, his first-year thesis focused on the subject of comparison between Dadaism and pop art.</p>
   <h1 class="dave">David Carson</h1>
    <p class="dave">His work is characterized by the chaotic typography and pattern it embodies<span class="carson"> disarray </span> of photos overlapping each other, seemingly meaningless at the surface but holding a larger picture. To put in simpler words as Albert Watson stated, the <span class="carson2"> disorganized use of his typography has </span> its own purpose, such as the each stroke of a painter’s brush evoke different emotion, imagery and idea, so does Carson’s designs possess such attributes.</p>
