            <p class="start">Typography is everywhere we look. It's in the books we read, on the websites we visit, even in everyday life—on street signs, bumper stickers, and product packaging.
            But what exactly is typography? Simply put, typography is the style or appearance of text. It can also refer to the art of working with text—something you probably do all the time if you create documents or other projects for work, school, or yourself.</p>

        <h2>MASSIMO VIGNELLI</h2>
            <p class="first">He was an Italian designer who worked in a number of areas ranging from package design through houseware design and furniture design to public signage and showroom design. He was the co-founder of Vignelli Associates, with his wife.</p>

        <h2>NEVILLE BRODY</h2>
            <p class="second">Brody made his name largely popular through his work as art director for The Face. He changed the "basic" and "structural" rules that existed in the British culture into a more artsy and vibrant aesthetic.[citation needed] His designs provoked some form of emotion to the extent that people would stick to one page instead of turning pages like they would normally do when reading a novel.[citation needed] Other international magazine and newspaper directions have included City Limits, Lei, Per Lui, Actuel and Arena, together with the radical new look for two leading British newspapers The Guardian and The Observer (both newspaper and magazine).[citation needed]</p>

        <h2>DAVID CARSON</h2>
            <p class="third">He is an American graphic designer, art director and surfer. He is best known for his innovative magazine design, and use of experimental typography. He was the art director for the magazine Ray Gun, in which he employed much of the typographic and layout approach for which he is known. In particular, his widely imitated aesthetic defined the so-called "grunge typography" era.</p>
